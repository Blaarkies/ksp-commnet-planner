    This application tracks anonymous usage data.
    Actions such as the following will be recorded, have user data anonymized,
    and then sent to the server.
    <ul>
      <li>Dragging a planet</li>
      <li>Using the Delta-V calculator</li>
      <li>Adjusting a craft's antennae count</li>
      <li>etc.</li>
    </ul>


    <p>This data provides me with a heat-map indicating
      which features are most often used,
    and this optimizes where effort is prioritized.</p>

    <p>No user names, craft names, planet names, or browser information will ever be collected for this.</p>

    <p>You can opt-out with the toggle below.</p>
