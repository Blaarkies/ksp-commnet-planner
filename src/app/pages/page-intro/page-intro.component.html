      <h2>Delta-v</h2>
      <p>
        Delta-v, dv, or formally Δv is a measure of <i>change in velocity</i>. This is the spaceship equivalent of
        talking about a car's <i>range</i>, or how much distance the car can travel without refueling. Because a
        spaceship in a stable orbit will continue travelling a huge distance without using any fuel at all, it is
        irrelevant measuring the spaceship's range in distance like we do with cars. Instead, spacecraft measure
        their capability in how much they can change their speed, as this ultimately determines if it can reach
        the Moon or beyond.
      </p>

      <section class="column-dual">
        <p>
          This delta-v can be measured practically by using up all the craft's fuel to thrust itself forward, and then
          finding the difference between the final velocity and the initial velocity. This <i>difference</i>, or
          rather<i>change in velocity</i> is the craft's delta-v capability. This is usually measured in meters per
          second
          <code>m/s</code>

      <p>
        Generally, spacecraft use their fuel to speed up to reach higher orbits, and also use fuel to slow down when
        moving to a lower orbit. Both of these maneuvers primarily changed the craft's velocity, and knowing how much
        delta-v the spacecraft is capable of delivering will improves mission success.
      </p>

      <section class="column-dual">
        <section>
          <h4>Why spacecraft would speed up</h4>
          <p>
            Consider a craft in a stable low Earth orbit. Without using fuel, it will stay in such an orbit for a long
            time. If the craft were to thrust itself forward, using fuel to increase it's velocity, this would also
            increase the orbit's height. Thus if the craft continues to increase its velocity, its higher orbit could
            intersect with the Moon. The craft expended a specific amount of delta-v to reach this new velocity.

          <h4>Why spacecraft would slow down</h4>
          <p>
            When a craft reaches the Moon, it will be approaching the Moon from outside of the Moon's gravitational
            influence. It will be pulled towards the Moon (it will "fall") and gain enough speed to swing by and escape
            the Moon's gravity. To reach a stable orbit, the craft has to thrust backwards to slow itself down. The
            craft would have to expend some delta-v to reach this new velocity.

        <p>
          Moving around in space while taking advantage of orbital mechanics lends itself to a systematic set of steps
          to reach the destination. Similar to how a car can use a specific highway as part of many different trips,
          spacecraft also use similar maneuvers for different trips.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's look at the delta-v cost of the steps from the surface of Kerbin to land on Mun:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>3400 m/s</td>
            <td>Launch from surface of Kerbin into Kerbin Low Orbit</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>852 m/s</td>
            <td>Burn prograde at Kerbin Low Orbit to reach an intercept with Mun</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>72 m/s</td>
            <td>Burn retrograde at Mun to slow down and capture into an elliptical orbit</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>199 m/s</td>
            <td>Burn retrograde to lower the elliptical orbit into a Mun Low Orbit</td>

        <br>

        <p>
          Any efficient trajectory will move through some of these steps on its way to the destination. For example, a
          refueling mission to the Mun space station will go through all these steps, except it will not perform the
          Mun surface landing step. Alternative routes are ofcourse possible, but they will be less efficient and
          cost more delta-v to achieve the same result.

        <h3>Calculating a craft's delta-v capability
          <a class="link" routerLink fragment="calculate-craft-dv"></a></h3>
        <p>
          A rocket is a vehicle that uses fuel to propel itself in order to deliver its payload to a destination. This
          thrust is ofcourse generated by rocket engines. It would seem quite difficult to determine the total delta-v
          capability if we look at the contributing factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thrust is constant</li>
          <li>Rocket mass decreases as fuel is used</li>
          <li>Acceleration increases as mass decreases</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To determine the total change in velocity possible, we need to multiply the acceleration by the time duration
          that the thrust was applied. The continually changing acceleration means we have to look at the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>
        </p>
        <div class="math-equation">

          <div><span class="large-bracket">)</span></div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Also known as the <i>classical rocket equation</i>, it looks far more complicated than it actually is. Given
          three important input values (efficiency, mass with fuel, mass without fuel), it calculates the craft's
          delta-v capability considering dynamically changing acceleration.

        A craft's delta-v capability can be improved by adding more boosters, or reducing the payload. Alternatively,
        new players may find it easier by expending less delta-v to achieve the same results. There are many situations
        in space flight where the more efficient methods are counter-intuitive.

          <h4>Launching into orbit from Kerbin
            <a class="link" routerLink fragment="launch-from-kerbin"></a></h4>
          <span>
             A craft on the launch pad requires these 2 conditions to be in a stable Kerbin orbit:
            </span>
          <ul>
            <li>An altitude above the atmosphere (70 km for Kerbin)</li>
            <li>A velocity towards the horizon (~2240 m/s)</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
            As altitude cannot be directly manipulated, the rocket needs to achieve a vertical velocity of
            ~1172 m/s in order to reach a 70 km altitude. This implies that a rocket needs a ~2240 m/s horizontal
            velocity, and also a ~1172 m/s vertical velocity to reach orbit. It is inefficient to do these as 2
            separate,
            sequential maneuvers. Instead, they should be executed as a gravity turn.
          </p>

          <p>
            Mathematically adding these velocity vectors as a single maneuver shows how the single burn costs less
            delta-v for the same result, as opposed to doing a vertical burn, and then a horizontal burn. In addition to
            this, launching due East on Kerbin saves ~175 m/s due to Kerbin's rotation in that direction.

        <p>
          Launching into orbit from a planet/moon without an atmosphere does not require a gravity turn. The most
          efficient trajectory is to maximise horizontal velocity, while maintaining a minimum altitude to avoid
          collisions with mountains. The means that the rocket does not have to point prograde, but should instead pitch
          over aggressively at launch.

          <p>
            Landing on any planet/moon without at atmosphere follows the same rules as launching from them, but in
            reverse. To efficiently land, first move the craft into a very low orbit, then reduce speed until the
            trajectory intersects the intended landing location. Wait until the craft nears this point of impact, then
            perform a suicide burn. The craft pitch might need to be constantly adjusted above/below retrograde to
            ensure
            that the altitude reaches 0 m at the same time that the velocity reaches 0 m/s.

            In practice there are more variables to consider (risk, craft TWR, mountains, landing target, etc.) which

          <p>
            Players sending their first craft to Duna (or any other planet) are putting most of their skills and
            knowledge to the test. In addition, this is a great situation to learn more about delta-v efficiency. A
            common first mistake is to launch into a solar orbit with barely enough velocity to escape Kerbin's gravity,
            and then once in solar orbit, to perform another burn to match orbit with Duna and essentially rendezvous.
            This is extremely inefficient because of the high orbital velocities involved in solar orbits.
          </p>
          <p>
            Efficient interplanetary transfer trajectories require that all maneuvers be executed at periapsis, which
            should ideally be as low as possible to extract a large advantage from the Oberth effect. The ejection burn
            should happen during a transfer window to minimize delta-v expenditure. This can seem
            immensely complex and high risk to new players, but even if performing this maneuver badly, it will still
            be less expensive than the solar-orbit-rendezvous method. It is expected that a small course correction
            maneuver be performed after the ejection burn, about halfway through the trip. This course correction
            can fine tune an intercept with Duna, and should not cost more than 20 m/s, but other planets with worse
            orbital inclinations could cost significantly more.

          <h4>Gravity assists and slingshots

          <p>
            When approaching a planet, a craft's speed measured relative to the planet, will be consistent between its
            entry and escape from the planet's gravity well as long as the craft remains ballistic (not actively
            changing course). This has the side effect that the craft's velocity changed direction after escaping the
            planet's gravity well. The craft's speed measured relative to the Sun could also change due to this,
            depending on how the planet curved the trajectory during the encounter.
          </p>

          <p>
            Around Kerbin, this can be used to increase the craft's speed by simply crossing the orbit of Mun from
            behind. This will cause the craft's Mun relative velocity to be deflected towards the forward direction of
            Mun, adding Kerbin relative speed to the craft as it passes through the encounter. This can reduce the cost
            of reaching Minmus, since the final trajectory will have a lower Minmus relative velocity.
          </p>

          <p>
            Missions to Jool can save upwards of 2000 m/s delta-v by using Tylo/Laythe to perform a reverse gravity
            assist. Trajectories that pass Tylo's orbit ahead of Tylo, will have their Tylo relative velocity redirected
            backwards, capturing the craft into a Jool orbit. A second gravity assist can lower the orbit to reach
            Laythe.
          </p>

          <p>
            These techniques can be used for multiple chained gravity assists between planets to cheaply reach the
            destination, at the cost of longer transit durations. Eve and Kerbin are good planets to use as a
            springboard to reach farther targets. Planetary gravity assists are intimidating at first, but following
            some simple rules you can keep craft out of danger.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Orbits will always pass through the point of the last maneuver performed. If you only burn at the planet
              intercept location, you will always be able to still intercept the planet at some point in the future.
            </li>
            <li>
              There is a practical limit to how much potential a gravity assist can provide, depending on the relative
              velocity and the planet's gravity. When the entry-escape trajectory deflects only a little, it is time to
              find an alternate gravity assist planet.

        <h4>Refueling by docking to infrastructure
          <a class="link" routerLink fragment="refueling-docking-infrastructure"></a></h4>
        <p>
          While not directly influencing the delta-v capability of a craft, refueling can have an tremendous effect
          on the total delta-v available on the mission. This does require some form of "infrastructure" along the
          mission trip (e.g. space station or surface base) for full effect, but some advantage can already be gained
          with a single launch vehicle.
        </p>

        <section>
          <h5>Direct ascent versus rendezvous</h5>
          <p>
            When building a mission to land on Mun, it will often require less total mass (and less fuel) to build a
            2-craft vehicle that undocks when in low orbit at Mun. The lander portion then performs the surface landing,
            while the command module portion stays in orbit, waiting for the lander to return to orbit and dock to
            transfer the crew. This requires less fuel to accomplish since the lander is not carrying the final portion
            of the mission down to the surface landing.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>Space station in orbit</h5>
          <p>
            Launch mass can be reduced by designing the craft to only have enough delta-v to rendezvous with a Kerbin
            space station, and then refuel before starting the next leg of its trip (e.g. ~1123 m/s to reach a low Mun
            orbit). This allows the craft to be conservative with fuel during its journey, but it does come at the cost
            of refueling the space station eventually. This however can be done inexpensively due to economies of scale
            by using dedicated massive fuel tankers.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h5>Fuel depots on the frontier</h5>
          <p>
            The price of fuel becomes more expensive the farther away the refueling location is, and this price
            difference is somewhat proportional to the delta-v needed to get there. When refueling a craft on Kerbin,
            this can be considered the cost price, but when refueling in Kerbin orbit we have to account for the initial
            launch costs for getting that fuel into orbit. This becomes worse for fuel in orbit around Duna, and even
            more for fuel at Moho. This can be avoided by investing in the
            <a href="https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/Converter">ISRU</a>
            parts to produce fuel on site, and this fuel can even be used as a discounted alternative to refuel other
            depots.

      <h2>CommNet</h2>
      <p>
        CommNet or KerbNet refers to the control communication system in game. This is a limitation placed on the
        transmission of science, and the control of probe core craft that do not have crew onboard. Control can be
        regained as long as a connection can be made back to the KSC (or nearby craft that provide remote control)
      </p>

      <p>
        The CommNet generally hinders players in early career mode from sending probes far out where much more science
        is available. Instead, their range slowly increases as the Tracking Station building is upgraded, or better
        communication antenna technology is unlocked. This range can however be increased earlier through the smart
        use of the relay satellites.
      </p>

    <section id="communication-satellite-constellations">
      <h3>Communication satellite constellations
        <a class="link" routerLink fragment="communication-satellite-constellations"></a></h3>
      <p>
        Placing a formation of relay satellites in the correct orbits can maximize the potential range of a signal back
        to Kerbin. These constellations should also consider how everything in orbit is always in motion; a rover on
        the far side of Mun needs a direct line-of-sight to Kerbin (or a relay satellite) in order to be controlled.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="ground-based-relays">
      <h4>Ground based relays
        <a class="link" routerLink fragment="ground-based-relays"></a></h4>
      <p>
        Early launches can potentially run into signal issues as they launch eastward and lose line-of-sight to the KSC
        over the horizon, which then lack any control to do the final burn to reach a stable orbit. The fix for this
        involves placing a relay antenna due east which can provide a signal back to the KSC. Placing them on mountain
        tops helps to increase the range between them without the horizon being in the way.

    <section id="low-orbit-constellations">
      <h4>Low orbit constellations
        <a class="link" routerLink fragment="low-orbit-constellations"></a></h4>
      <p>
        It is beneficial to have chain of relays close to Kerbin. These provide an important link to maintaining
        permanent communication with ground based vehicles, planes, other craft in low orbit, and especially craft
        that have re-entered the atmosphere waiting for you to activate their parachutes.

    <section id="high-orbit-constellations">
      <h4>High orbit constellations
        <a class="link" routerLink fragment="high-orbit-constellations"></a></h4>
      <p>
        Placing 4 powerful relays in orbits higher than Mun can maintain a direct line-of-sight to its far side. This
        can help rovers stay in control before losing signal near a cliff. It is important that these relays be spaced
        equally, and maintain equal orbital periods as to not drift towards each other.
      </p>

    <section id="primary-planetary-relays">
      <h4>Primary planetary relays
        <a class="link" routerLink fragment="primary-planetary-relays"></a></h4>
      <p>
        A powerful relay in orbit around Duna will provide a connection to local craft for only a portion of its orbit.
        It loses signal when behind Duna, and thus will not provide signal to the local craft. This can be avoided by
        placing it in a highly elliptical polar orbit with the periapsis close to Duna's south pole. This will also pass
        behind Duna at some point in its orbit, but it will do so for a very short duration, and then move very slowly
        towards the apoapsis where it spends most of its time during the orbit. In over 99% of the orbital period, the
        relay will remain somewhere above the north pole with a direct line-of-sight to that hemisphere and most of the
        space surrounding Duna. This of course works for any other planet/moon as well.

    <section id="remote-control-stations">
      <h4>Remote control stations
        <a class="link" routerLink fragment="remote-control-stations"></a></h4>
      <p>
        Crewed vehicles will always have some sort of control. A relay craft fitted with a
        <a href="https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/RC-001S_Remote_Guidance_Unit">RC-001S Remote Guidance Unit</a>
        and a pilot on board, will also be able to provide remote control to probes in the local area. They will not be
        able to transmit science, but will have control to achieve landings and orbital maneuvers.

      The information herein is based on the game 'Kerbal Space Program', and although it might reference the Earth/Moon
      and other concepts outside the game, the methods and physics here are only intended to be accurate in the game.
      While the game is a fairly accurate representation of spaceflight, it does prioritize gameplay to some degree,
