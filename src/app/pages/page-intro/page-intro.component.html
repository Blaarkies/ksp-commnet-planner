      <h1>KSP Visual Calculator</h1>
      <p>
        This online tool calculates delta-v and CommNet requirements in KSP (a video game, Kerbal Space Program). It
        helps KSP players plan and solve complex missions. Just like the game, these calculators are made to be
        interactive and visual to help new comers quickly grasp the mechanics of rocket science.

      <h2>Delta-v</h2>
      <p>
        Delta-v, dv, or formally Î”v is a measure of <i>change in velocity</i>. This is the spaceship equivalent of
        talking about a car's <i>range</i>, or how much distance the car can travel without refueling. Because a
        spaceship in a stable orbit will continue travelling a huge distance without using any fuel at all, it is
        irrelevant measuring the spaceship's range in distance like we do with cars. Instead, spacecraft measure
        their capability in how much they can change their speed, as this ultimately determines if it can reach
        the Moon or beyond.
      </p>

      <section class="column-dual">
        <p>
          This delta-v can be measured practically by using up all the craft's fuel to thrust itself forward, and then
          finding the difference between the final velocity and the initial velocity. This <i>difference</i>, or
          rather<i>change in velocity</i> is the craft's delta-v capability. This is usually measured in meters per
          second
          <code>m/s</code>
        </p>

        <aside class="contains-header max-content">
          <div><i>Velocity is speed with specific direction</i></div>
          <small>The velocity of an object is the rate of change of its position with respect to a frame of
            reference.</small>

      <h3>Why is delta-v an important measure?</h3>
      <p>
        Generally, spacecraft use their fuel to speed up to reach higher orbits, and also use fuel to slow down when
        moving to a lower orbit. Both of these maneuvers primarily changed the craft's velocity, and knowing how much
        delta-v the spacecraft is capable of delivering will improves mission success.
      </p>

      <section class="column-dual">
        <section>
          <h4>Example of Speeding Up to Go Somewhere</h4>
          <p>
            Consider a craft in a stable low Earth orbit. Without using fuel, it will stay in such an orbit for a long
            time. If the craft were to thrust itself forward, using fuel to increase it's velocity, this would also
            increase the orbit's height. Thus if the craft continues to increase its velocity, its higher orbit could
            intersect with the Moon. The craft expended a specific amount of delta-v to reach this new velocity.

          <h4>Example of Slowing Down to Go Somewhere</h4>
          <p>
            Consider a craft returning to Earth from an interplanetary trip from Mars. As it reaches the gravitational
            influence of Earth, it will be pulled toward Earth (it will "fall"). This will cause it to gain speed, but
            if left without any changes, it will also swing past Earth and escape the gravitational influence at the
            same initial speed. To reach a stable orbit around Earth, the craft has to thrust backwards to slow itself
            down. The craft expended a specific amount of delta-v to reach this new velocity.

        <h3>How to determine the total delta-v required for a mission</h3>
        <p>
          Moving around in space while taking advantage of orbital mechanics lends itself to a systematic set of steps
          to reach the destination. Similar to how a car can use a specific highway as part of many different trips,
          spacecraft also use similar maneuvers for different trips.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's look at the delta-v cost of the steps from the surface of Kerbin to land on Mun:
        </p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td>3400 m/s</td>
            <td>Launch from surface of Kerbin into Kerbin Low Orbit</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>852 m/s</td>
            <td>Burn prograde at Kerbin Low Orbit to reach an intercept with Mun</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>72 m/s</td>
            <td>Burn retrograde at Mun to slow down and capture into an elliptical orbit</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>199 m/s</td>
            <td>Burn retrograde to lower the elliptical orbit into a Mun Low Orbit</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>580 m/s</td>
            <td>Slow down at surface to land on Mun</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td class="double-line"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>5103 m/s</td>
            <td>Total delta-v required</td>
          </tr>
        </table>

        <br>

        <p>
          Any efficient trajectory will move through some of these steps on its way to the destination. For example, a
          refueling mission to the Mun space station will go through all these steps, except it will not perform the
          Mun surface landing step. Alternative routes are ofcourse possible, but they will be less efficient and
          cost more delta-v to achieve the same result.

        <h3>How to calculate a craft's delta-v capability</h3>
        <p>
          A rocket is a vehicle that uses fuel to propel itself in order to deliver its payload to a destination. This
          thrust is ofcourse generated by rocket engines. It would seem quite difficult to determine the total delta-v
          capability if we look at the contributing factors:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Thrust is constant</li>
          <li>Rocket mass decreases as fuel is used</li>
          <li>Acceleration increases as mass decreases</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          To determine the total change in velocity possible, we need to multiply the acceleration by the time duration
          that the thrust was applied. The continually changing acceleration means we have to look at the
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a>
        </p>
        <div class="math-equation">
          <div><i>delta-v</i> = I<sub>sp</sub>&nbsp;<i>g</i>&nbsp;ln<span class="large-bracket">(</span></div>
          <div class="fraction"><sup>mass<sub>wet</sub></sup><sub>mass<sub>dry</sub></sub></div>
          <div><span class="large-bracket">)</span></div>
        </div>

        <p>
          Also known as the <i>classical rocket equation</i>, it looks far more complicated than it actually is. Given
          three important input values (efficiency, mass with fuel, mass without fuel), it calculates the craft's
          delta-v capability considering dynamically changing acceleration.
        </p>

        <p>
          Using a craft with fitted with a
          <a href="https://wiki.kerbalspaceprogram.com/wiki/LV-909_%22Terrier%22_Liquid_Fuel_Engine">
            "Terrier" rocket engine</a>
          , 8 tons of mass<sub>wet</sub>, and 3 tons of mass<sub>dry</sub> we get these results:

            <input type="number" min="0" value="350" (input)="calcDv.isp = $event.target.value">
          </div>
          <div>9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup></div>
          <div>ln<span class="large-bracket">(</span></div>
          <div>
            <div class="suffix t">
              <input type="number" [min]="calcDv.dry" value="8" (input)="calcDv.wet = $event.target.value">

            <div class="divider-line"></div>
            <div class="suffix t">

          </div>

        </form>

        <p>
          Feel free to change these input values to match a rocket that you have in mind, it will update accordingly.
